    * Or an email with a link to confirm that they aren't taking any?
    * Or just require 28 days notice and keep it manual?
    * Or publish holiday somewhere and alert clients or DMs automatically to absences?
    * Or push Breathe holiday into Forecast and then create some way for clients to see their project in Forecast?

## Terms of your employment

1. ### Employer
    1. You are employed by The Dextrous Web Ltd, a company registered in England and Wales under number 6617101, trading as dxw. Our registered office is at Unit B7, 8-9 Hoxton Square, Greater London, N1 6NU.

2. ### Date of commencement
    1. The date for the purposes of calculating your statutory period of continuous employment with the company is your date of commencement, unless otherwise specified in the above table. This takes into account any unbroken employment with us, or any associated company. Service with your previous employer does not count as part of your continuous period of employment with us.

3. ### Pay
    1. You will be paid monthly in arrears by transfer to your bank or building society account on the last weekday of each calendar month.
    2. You must always maintain a suitable bank or building society account into which payment can be made, and provide us with current details of it. Changes to your bank or building society details must be notified to us in writing.
    3. We reserve the right to deduct an amount from any payment due to use from us, or to recover the amound directly from you, if:
        1. there is an overpayment of wages, expenses or any other sum paid to you during your employment;
        2. you are paid expenses which are subsequently disallowed;
        3. there is an outstanding amount due on any loan or advance paid to you by us;
        4. we become liable for any damage, loss of property, fine or charge as a result of your negligence, dishonesty, breach of contract or failure to follow the company's policies.
    4.  We do not have any arrangements for the paying of bonuses.

4. ### Hours of work
    1. Unless you work part-time, your normal working day is seven hours long, making a 35 hour working week. During busy periods, you may be required to work longer hours, up to a maximum of 50 hours a week, on average, over a rolling six week period.
    2. Your normal working hours are 10:00am to 6:00pm with an hour off for lunch. We are open to arrangements for flexible working hours, at the company's sole discretion.
    3. We do not operate any overtime scheme.

5. ### Variable part-time staff
    1. If your pay is specified as being *variable part time* then you will work for a number days per week to be agreed by the end of business on Wednesday of the previous week.
    2. You will be paid pro rata as follows: the number of days you have worked each month will be divided by the number of weekdays (Monday to Friday) in the same month, the resulting fraction will be multiplied by one twelfth of the equivalent full time annual salary to give the amount of pay you are entitled to in that month.

6. ### Fixed part-time staff
    1. If your pay is specified as being "fixed part time" then you will work for a number days per week to be agreed at the commencement of this contract.
    2. You will be paid pro rata as follows: the number of days you work each week will be divided by five, the resulting fraction will be multiplied by one twelfth of the equivalent full time annual salary to give the amount of pay you are entitled to each month.

7. ### Probationary period
    1. You will be subject to an initial four month probationary period.
    2. If at the conclusion of your probationary period the company requires more time to assess your performance, your probationary period may be extended by a further two months.

8. ### Notice period
    1. In cases of gross misconduct, you may be dismissed without notice. The following is an indicative, non-exhaustive list of things that might constitute gross misconduct:
        1. insubordination;
        2. committing an unlawful act or being convicted for a criminal offence that impacts on your employment;
        3. fighting or assaulting another person or causing another person to fear violence;
        3. deliberately damaging property;
        4. dishonesty, theft or fraud;
        5. deliberately or recklessly disclosing confidential information or personal data to a third party;
        6. willfully or seriously breaching the terms of this contract.
    2. Other than in cases of gross misconduct, your notice period:
        1. during your probationary period is two weeks;
        2. following your probationary period up to the second anniversary of your commencement date is six weeks;
        3. after the second anniversary of your commencement date, six weeks plus an additional week for each year of service up to a maximum of 12 weeks.
    3. These periods apply to both you and the company, irrespective of who is giving notice to whom.
    4. Notice will only be effective if given in writing, which includes by e-mail.
    5. Once notice has been given (whether from you to us, or from us to you), we reserve the right, at any time after the notice was given while you are still employed with us, to give you pay in lieu of notice. This means that we will pay you, as a lump sum, the salary that would otherwise be payable to you during the unexpired portion of your notice period.

9. ### Holiday entitlement
    1. We operate a holiday year which runs from 1st July to 30th June in the following year.
    2. Leave accrues throughout the year according to the formula given below, resulting in 33 days paid leave for full time staff and a pro rata proportion for those working part time.
    3. Unless notified otherwise you will be required to take all Bank Holidays and Public Holidays as leave and those days are counted in the total of 33 days.
    4. You may carry over a maximum of five days' leave from one holiday year to the next.
    5. At any time in a leave year, your accrued leave entitlement may be calculated as follows: 2.08 x Number of days worked in the year to date / 21.75
    6. The amount of leave you may take will be the total leave accrued, rounded up to the nearest half a day, minus any leave you have already taken in the leave year.
    7. We will usually permit you to take up to five days leave in advance of it being accrued.
    8. If you wish to take leave, you must obtain approval (which will not be unreasonably withheld) and give notice of:
        1. 28 days for a period of leave longer than two days;
        2. seven days for a period of two days or less.
    9. When your employment ends, you will receive payment in lieu for any part of your leave entitlement which has accrued but which has not been taken. Similarly, if you have taken more leave than you have accrued, we will deduct the appropriate amount of pay from any payment due from us to you on the termination of your employment or, if this is insufficient, we will require you to make up any shortfall.
