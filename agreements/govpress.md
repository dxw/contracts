        1.  Agree that our recommendations are appropriate based on the
            information available;
        2.  Understand that the breakdown of fees in the Proposal is a predicion
            based on the assumptions made in the proposal;
        3.  Understand that the total fees over the life of the contract

    4.  GovPress must only be used in accordance with its Acceptable Usage Policy,
        which forms part of this agreement.

5. ### Availability

    1.  You agree that occasional unavailability of your website is not
        something that can reasonably be avoided.

    2.  Nonetheless, dxw will make every reasonable effort to ensure that
        your website is accessible over the internet 100% of the time, excluding
        periods of planned maintenance.

    3.  If despite dxw's reasonable efforts your website is unavailable outside
        of a planned maintenance period, dxw will on request refund or waive the
        infrastructure fees for any period of unavailability longer than one hour.

    4.  Clause 5.3 shall not apply if the unavailability is a result of events that
        are beyond dxw's control.

    5.  From time to time, we may need to make your website unavailable in order to
        carry out essential maintenance. dxw will make every reasonable effort to
        give you as much notice as possible when planned unavailability will occur,
        and will complete such work outside the hours of 09:00-18:00 Monday-Friday
        whenever it is reasonably possible.

6. ### Enhancement of the service

    1.  dxw may at any time make changes to GovPress without giving
        notice. We will inform you as soon as is practical of any change
        which may have an impact upon your use of GovPress.

    2.  dxw will not make any changes that remove or materially impair the
        supply of the services described in clauses 4.1 and 4.2 of this contract.

    3.  Changes made by dxw under this clause 5 will normally have no detectable
        effect on the operation of your website. If you make a reasonable request
        to us to fix a problem with the operation of your website that has arisen
        out of any change we have made to GovPress, we will make reasonable efforts
        to fix the reported problem.

7. ### Support

    1.  At any time, you may create a Support Ticket.

    2.  dxw will make reasonable efforts to respond to Support Tickets
        within the period of time specified in our Service Level Agreement,
        which forms part of this contract.

    3.  All contact regarding the services dxw provides as part of this
        contract must be made via Support Tickets.

    4.  You understand that any contact you make with us that is not via a
        Support Ticket may be overlooked or disregarded and that any
        consequent failure on our part to respond to you or take or not take
        some action will not be a breach of this contract.

    5.  At any time, you may create an Emergency Support Ticket if you
        are experiencing a problem that meets the criteria for an
        emergency as described in the Service Level Agreement.

    6.  If you create Emergency Support Tickets in situations which do
        not meet the criteria for an emergency, dxw may withdraw your
        ability to submit Emergency Support Tickets.

    7.  You understand that if you are experiencing an emergency but
        do not create an Emergency Support Ticket, our response time
        may be considerably increased and your service may be disrupted
        for a prolonged period as a result.

8. ### Time allowance

    1.  dxw's initial fee for Fully Managed support is calculated from the
        Time Allowance, which is based on our assessment of your website's
        likely support requirements, as stated in the proposal.

    2.  dxw will track time spent providing the services specified in this
        contract in sufficient detail to be able to provide an approximation
        of the time required to service your website in any given month.

    3.  In any given month, dxw will carry out all of the services provided
        under this contract with no additional fee, provided that the Time
        Allowance has not been exceeded.

    4.  In any given month, if dxw chooses to complete work in excess of the
        Time Allowance, no additional fee will be payable. Any such work is
        completed at dxw's absolute discretion and the fact that dxw does so on
        one occasion will not imply that dxw will do so on subsequent occasions.

    4.  In any given month, if dxw chooses not to complete work in excess of
        the Time Allowance, we may notify you, and, subject to our availability,
        will complete that work if dxw's fees for the additional work are paid.
        dxw will not complete any such work without your authorisation.

    6.  The Time Allowance may be varied by agreement, and with a corresponding
        change to dxw's fees.

    7.  dxw will not ordinarily agree to a reduction in the Time Allowance if
        to do so would impede our ability to provide services under this agreement
        to a professional standard.

    8.  If your Time Allowance is reguarly exceeded, or almost exceeded, dxw
        may notify you that this is the case, and request that the Time
        Allowance be increased.

    9.  If you do not agree to increase the Time Allowance, dxw may require
        you to reduce the workload that your website generates; for example, by
        submitting fewer Support Tickets.

    10. The Time Allowance is calculated per month. Unusused time is not carried
        over and may not be used in any subsequent month.

    10. dxw may, for a fee, be able to advise you on alternative approaches
        to managing your website that could reduce your operational costs.

    11. The Time Allowance will have no bearing on dxw's provision of the
        services detailed in clauses 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3 and 4.1.4.

9. ### Installation of plugins

    1.  The terms in this section only apply to you if your website is Fully
        Managed, or if your Partly Managed service includes WordPress plugin
        updates or installation.

    2.  At any time, you may create a Support Ticket to ask us to install a
        plugin on your website.

    3.  If you ask dxw to install a plugin, we will conduct an assessment of
        that plugin intended to give a broad understanding of the kinds of
        security problems that plugin may have.

    4.  Based on dxw's assessment of a plugin, dxw may refuse to install that
        plugin or updates for that plugin.

    5.  Plugin security assessments are intended only to give a broad
        understanding of a plugin's security status. The results are opinions
        only. dxw neither offers any guarantee that a plugin whose assessment
        produced positive results does not contain security vulnerabilities,
        nor that negative results necessarily imply that a plugin does contain
        security vulnerabilities.

10. ### Suspension

    1.  dxw may suspend the services provided as part of this agreement if:

        1.  You fail to pay invoices whose total value is greater than or equal
            to our total fee for the preceeding two months' usage of GovPress;
        2.  As a last resort, it is necessary for us to do so in order to
            protect your data or another GovPress user's information
            security, or to protect other users of the internet.

    2.  In the event that the services are suspended, dxw will replace your
        website with a message stating that your website is down for maintenance.

11. ### Required Materials

    1.  In order to resolve Support Tickets, there will occasionally be
        Required Materials that you must provide.
    2.  You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
        practical.
    3.  If work on a Support Ticket cannot take place without Required
        Materials, we will suspend work on that ticket.

12. ### Quality

    1.  dxw will deliver work of a professional standard.
    2.  dxw is insured against professional negligence to a value of
        £1,000,000 (the "insured sum"). dxw would be willing to negotiate
        an increase in the insured sum on condition that we were able to
        pass on any corresponding increase in the premium.

13. ### Limitation of liability

    1.  dxw cannot guarantee perfect reliability.
    2.  dxw will deliver work that is as robust and reliable as is
        reasonably practical.
    3.  You acknowledge that all software of non-trivial size contains bugs,
        including security vulnerabilities, and that it is not
        reasonably practical to deliver bug-free software.
    4.  dxw will not be liable for any loss of profits or reputation
        that you suffer, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of any
        failure of the Product.
    5.  You agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that you put
        in place measures that make you able to operate in the event of
        any such failure. dxw can work with you to design or implement
        such measures at your request for an agreed fee.
    6.  Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
        liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.
    7.  In any event, dxw's total liability under this agreement is
        limited to the lesser of:

        1. The total cost of the Project.
        2. The insured sum.

14. ### Confidentiality

    1.  dxw believe that it is best to be open.
    2.  dxw will generally not keep the details of your website
        confidential, including by not limited to:

        1.  The fact that dxw has a commercial relationship with you;
        2.  The nature and goals of your website;
        3.  The cost to host your website.

    3.  However, dxw do regard the following as confidential:

        1.  The specific content of documents or copy that will be
            published on any of your websites that is not yet publicly
            available, most especially the content of forthcoming
            strategy or policy announcements;
        2.  Personal data dxw aquires during the course of hosting your
            website;
        3.  The content or existence of any document you send to us that
            is protectively marked.

    4.  If you have addional confidentiality requirements, you must tell
        us in writing as soon as is reasonably practical.


15. ### Intellectual property in GovPress

    1.  Except as provided for in clause 15, nothing in this agreement is
        intended to transfer any intellectual property right.

    2.	To the extent that it is able (either through ownership or because it
        is licensed under a licence that permits sublicensing) dxw licenses all
        intellectual property rights in GovPress to you for the sole purpose
        of carrying out this agreement.

    3.	To the extent that it is not able to give the licence in 15.2 above,
        dxw has taken reasonable steps to check that all intellectual property

        GovPress as envisaged under this agreement.

16. ### Intellectual property in your website

    1.  To the extent that you are able, you grant us a sufficient licence over

    2. 	To the extent that you are unable to grant the licence under clause
        16.1 above, you shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that any
        material supplied to us that is affected by third party intellectual
        property rights, may be used as part of the operation of your website
        under this agreement.

    3.	Where, under this agreement, we create works, such as computer programs
        and documentation, that were specifically written for and incorporated
        into your website, then we assign to you (as a future assignment of
        copyright) the copyright in the works, subject to a licence from you to
        dxw that allows dxw to use the works in the course of our business and, in
        particular, as part of any website we may host.

        action or other circumstances beyond our reasonable control.

19. ### Changes to these terms

        written notice.
    2.  If any proposed change in these terms puts you at a material
        disadvantage you may send us a written objection, in which case,
        the change will not be binding on you.
    3.  Any such written objection must be sent within 14 days of the
        the notice dxw sends you.
    4.  This clause does not apply if it would violate the terms of a
        framework agreement of which this agreement forms a part.
