## 10th April 2017

1. ### Parties

    1.  This agreement is between The Dextrous Web Ltd, a company
        registered in England and Wales under number 6617101, trading as
        "dxw digital", and the organisation or person specified on the order
        summary accompanying this document.


2. ### Definitions

    Emergency Support Ticket
    :   An Emergency Support Ticket is a Support Ticket created when an email
        is sent to support-emergency@dxw.com. Its creation will result in alerts
        being sent to members of dxw digital staff at any time of day or night.

    GovPress
    :	  The software and hardware platform, including WordPress, on which dxw digital will
        host your website, is known as GovPress.

    Overprovisioned Capacity
    :   Overprovisioned Capacity is a quantity of computing time, or any
        other resource, which is made available to your website but is in excess
        of the quantity we believe your website will require. It is allocated
        in order to reduce the risk of failure when websites are launched
        whose capacity requirements are uncertain.

    Proposal
    :	A Proposal is a document containing the information listed in clause 3.2.

    Service Level Agreement
    :	Service Level Agreement refers to the document available at http://dext.ly/sla,
        which sets out our responsiveness targets.

    Acceptable Usage Policy
    :   Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP) refers to the document available at http://dext.ly/aup,
        which sets out restrictions on the way the service may be used.

    Service Usage
    :   Service Usage is the accumulated quantity of hours of computing time
        and gigabytes of data stored or transferred in a given period.

    Staging Environment
    :   A Staging Environment is a private copy of your live website, which
        can be used to test changes or new content in private before making
        changes to your publicly available live website. The Staging Environment
        differs substantially from the live environment, is not monitored and is
        not backed up. It is suitable only for minor testing with unclassified content.

    Pre-production Environment
    :   A Pre-production Environment is a private copy of your live website which
        you can use to conduct automated testing or detailed content work.
        The Pre-production Environment is a close copy of your live website and
        is suitable for detailed content and assurance work.

    Support Ticket
    :   A Support Ticket is a task, created by completing an online form or
        sending an email to support@dxw.com, which will be assigned to
        a member of staff at dxw digital for their attention or action.

    Time Allowance
    :   The Time Allowance is a notional quantity of time allocated for use in
        providing services under this contract.

        1.  Agree that our recommendations are appropriate based on the

        3.  Quarterly review meetings during which we will discuss aspects

        4.  Faster ("enhanced") response times to tickets, as described in our
            Service Level Agreement.

    4.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, dxw digital will not, under this contract,
        provide any service not specified in clause 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3, including
        but not limited to:

        1.  Support for any third-party services upon which your service relies;
        2.  Changes to your website which constitute new functionality.

    5.  GovPress must only be used in accordance with its Acceptable Usage Policy,
        which forms part of this agreement.


5. ### Availability

    1.  You agree that occasional unavailability of your website is not
        something that can reasonably be avoided.

    2.  Nonetheless, dxw digital will make every reasonable effort to ensure that
        your website is accessible over the internet 100% of the time, excluding
        periods of planned maintenance.

    3.  If despite dxw digital's reasonable efforts your website is unavailable outside
        of a planned maintenance period, dxw digital will on request refund or waive the
        infrastructure fees for any period of unavailability longer than one hour.

    4.  Clause 5.3 shall not apply if the unavailability is a result of events that
        are beyond dxw digital's control.

    5.  From time to time, we may need to make your website unavailable in order to
        carry out essential maintenance. dxw digital will make every reasonable effort to
        give you as much notice as possible when planned unavailability will occur,
        and will complete such work outside the hours of 09:00-18:00 Monday-Friday
        whenever it is reasonably possible.


6. ### Enhancement of the service

    1.  dxw digital may at any time make changes to GovPress without giving
        notice. We will inform you as soon as is practical of any change
        which may have an impact upon your use of GovPress.

    2.  dxw digital will not make any changes that remove or materially impair the
        supply of the services described in clauses 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of this contract.

    3.  Changes made by dxw digital under this clause will normally have no detectable
        effect on the operation of your website. If you make a reasonable request
        to us to fix a problem with the operation of your website that has arisen
        out of any change we have made to GovPress, we will make reasonable efforts
        to fix the reported problem.


7. ### Support

    1.  At any time, you may create a Support Ticket.

    2.  dxw digital will make reasonable efforts to respond to Support Tickets
        within the period of time specified in our Service Level Agreement.

    3.  All contact regarding the services dxw digital provides as part of this
        contract must be made via Support Tickets.

    4.  You understand that any contact you make with us that is not via a
        Support Ticket may be overlooked or disregarded and that any
        consequent failure on our part to respond to you or to take or not take
        some action will not be a breach of this contract.

    5.  At any time, you may create an Emergency Support Ticket if you
        are experiencing a problem that meets the criteria for an
        emergency as described in the Service Level Agreement.

    6.  If you create Emergency Support Tickets in situations which do
        not meet the criteria for an emergency, dxw digital may withdraw your
        ability to submit Emergency Support Tickets.

    7.  You understand that if you are experiencing an emergency but
        do not create an Emergency Support Ticket, our response time
        may be considerably increased and your service may be disrupted
        for a longer period as a result.


8. ### Time allowance

    1.  dxw digital's initial fee for Managed support is calculated from the
        Time Allowance, which is based on our assessment of your website's
        likely support requirements, as stated in the proposal.

    2.  dxw digital will track time spent providing the services specified in this
        contract in sufficient detail to be able to provide an approximation
        of the time required to service your website in any given month.

    3.  In any given month, dxw digital will carry out all of the services provided
        under this contract with no additional fee, provided that the Time
        Allowance has not been exceeded.

    4.  In any given month, if dxw digital chooses to complete work in excess of the
        Time Allowance, no additional fee will be payable. Any such work is
        completed at dxw digital's absolute discretion and the fact that dxw digital does so on
        one occasion will not imply that dxw digital will do so on subsequent occasions.

    4.  In any given month, if dxw digital chooses not to complete work in excess of
        the Time Allowance, we may notify you, and, subject to our availability,
        will complete that work if dxw digital's fees for the additional work are paid.
        dxw digital will not charge a fee for any such work without your authorisation.

    6.  The Time Allowance may be varied by agreement, and with a corresponding
        change to dxw digital's fees.

    7.  dxw digital will not ordinarily agree to a reduction in the Time Allowance if
        to do so would impede our ability to provide services under this agreement
        to a professional standard.

    8.  If your Time Allowance is regularly exceeded, or almost exceeded, dxw digital
        may notify you that this is the case, and request that the Time
        Allowance be increased.

    9.  If you do not agree to increase the Time Allowance, dxw digital may require
        you to reduce the workload that your website generates; for example, by
        submitting fewer Support Tickets or carrying out remedial development work
        at your own cost.

    10. The Time Allowance is calculated per month. Unused time is not carried
        over and may not be used in any subsequent month.

    10. dxw digital may, for a fee, be able to advise you on alternative approaches
        to managing your website that could reduce your operational costs.

    11. The Time Allowance will have no bearing on dxw digital's provision of the
        services detailed in clauses 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3 and 4.1.4.


9. ### Installation of plugins

    1.  For a fee, dxw digital will conduct an assessment of a WordPress plugin intended
        to give a broad understanding of the kinds of security problems that
        plugin may have.

    2.  dxw digital may refuse to permit the use of any plugin or plugin update if our
        assessment indicates that it presents unacceptable security risks.

    3.  Plugin security assessments are intended only to give a broad
        understanding of a plugin's security status. The results are opinions
        only. dxw digital neither offers any guarantee that a plugin whose assessment
        produced positive results does not contain security vulnerabilities,
        nor that negative results necessarily mean that a plugin does contain
        security vulnerabilities.


10. ### Suspension

    1.  dxw digital may suspend the services provided as part of this agreement if:

        1.  You fail to pay invoices whose total value is greater than or equal
            to our total fee for the preceding two months' usage of GovPress;
        2.  As a last resort, it is necessary for us to do so in order to
            protect your data or another GovPress user's security, or to protect
            other users of the internet.

    2.  In the event that the services are suspended, dxw digital will replace your
        website with a message stating that your website is down for maintenance.


11. ### Required Materials

    1.  In order to resolve Support Tickets, there will occasionally be
        Required Materials that you must provide.
    2.  You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
        practical.
    3.  If work on a Support Ticket cannot take place without Required
        Materials, we will suspend work on that ticket.


12. ### Quality

    1.  dxw digital will deliver work of a professional standard.
    2.  dxw digital is insured against professional negligence to a value of £2,000,000.


13. ### Limitation of liability

    1.  dxw digital cannot guarantee perfect reliability.
    2.  dxw digital will deliver work that is as robust and reliable as is reasonably
        practical.
    3.  You acknowledge that all software of non-trivial size contains bugs,
        including security vulnerabilities, and that it is not reasonably
        practical to deliver bug-free software.
    4.  dxw digital will not be liable for any loss of profits or reputation that you
        suffer, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of any failure of
        GovPress or the WordPress site that it hosts.
    5.  You agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that you put
        in place measures that make you able to operate in the event of
        any such failure. dxw digital can work with you to design or implement
        such measures at your request for an agreed fee.
    6.  Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
        liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.
    7.  In any event, dxw digital's total liability under this agreement is
        limited to the lesser of:

        1. The total fees for a year of GovPress service;
        2. The insured sum.


14. ### Confidentiality

    1.  dxw digital believe that it is best to be open.
    2.  dxw digital will generally not keep the details of your website confidential,
        including by not limited to:

        1.  The fact that dxw digital has a commercial relationship with you;
        2.  The nature and goals of your website;
        3.  The cost to host your website.

    3.  However, dxw digital do regard the following as confidential:

        1.  The specific content of documents or content that will be
            published on any of your websites that is not yet publicly
            available, most especially the content of forthcoming
            strategy or policy announcements;
        2.  Personal data dxw digital acquires during the course of hosting your
            website;
        3.  The content or existence of any document you send to us that
            is protectively marked.

    4.  If you have additional confidentiality requirements, you must tell
        us in writing as soon as is reasonably practical.

        intended to transfer any intellectual property right.

        GovPress as envisaged under this agreement.

    4.	If, under this agreement, we create works, such as computer programs

    2. 	To the extent that you are unable to grant the licence under clause
        16.1 above, you shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that any

        property rights, may be used as part of the operation of your website
        under this agreement.

    3.  dxw digital may place links or representative screenshots of your WordPress
        service along with your name or logo on a dxw digital website or within
        other promotional material. To the extent that these materials are owned by

        of GovPress up to the date of termination, which you shall pay.

    4.  In the event that the Proposal includes a service which takes place less
        frequently than monthly but whose cost is apportioned per month:

        1. If the service has already been carried out, your final invoice will
           include a charge equal to the amount of the fees for that service
           not yet accrued;
        2. If the service has not already been carried out, no refund will be due
           for the fees accrued at the time of termination.
