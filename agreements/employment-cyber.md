2. ### Date of commencement
    1. The date for the purposes of calculating your statutory period of continuous employment with dxw cyber is your date of commencement, unless otherwise specified in the above table. This takes into account any unbroken employment with us, or any associated company. Service with your previous employer does not count as part of your continuous period of employment with us.

3. ### Employee warranties
    1. By entering into this agreement, you warrant to dxw cyber that:
      1. You will not be in breach of any court order nor of any other contractual obligation you are bound by;
      2. You are entitled to work in the United Kingdom without any additional approvals and will notify dxw cyber immediately if you cease to be so entitled during your employment with us.

4. ### Duties
    1. During your employment with us, unless prevented by incapacity (see clause 14.1), you must:
        1. complete your work expeditiously, diligently, and to the best of your ability;
        2. comply with all reasonable and lawful directions you are given by dxw cyber;
        3. report any wrongdoing, whether your own or by another employee or director of dxw cyber, as soon as you become aware of it;
        4. use your best endeavours to promote, protect, develop and extend dxw cyber's work and mission;
        5. as far as you are able, behave in ways which embody dxw cyber's values, as published in the Playbook;
        6. follow dxw cyber's policies, as published and varied from time to time.

5. ### Pay
    1. You will be paid monthly in arrears by transfer to your bank or building society account on the last weekday of each calendar month.
    2. You must always maintain a suitable bank or building society account into which payment can be made, and provide us with current details of it. Changes to your bank or building society details must be notified to us in writing.
    3. We reserve the right to deduct an amount from any payment due to you from us, or to recover the amount directly from you, if:
        1. there is an overpayment of wages, expenses or any other sum paid to you during your employment;
        2. you are paid expenses which are subsequently disallowed;
        3. there is an outstanding amount due on any loan or advance paid to you by us;
        4. we become liable for any damage, loss of property, fine or charge as a result of your negligence, dishonesty, breach of contract or failure to follow dxw cyber's policies.
    4. We do not have any arrangements for the paying of bonuses.
    5. We do not operate any overtime scheme.

6. ### Hours of work
    1. Unless you work part-time, your normal working day is seven hours long, making a 35 hour working week. There will be occasions where you will be required to work longer hours to meet the needs of dxw cyber or its clients. In such cases, you will not be required to work more than 48 hours per week, on average, over a rolling six week period.
    2. Your normal working hours are 10:00am to 6:00pm with an hour off for lunch. We are open to arrangements for flexible working hours, at dxw cyber's sole discretion.

7. ### Variable part-time staff
    1. If your pay is specified as being variable part time then you will work for a number days per week to be agreed by the end of business on Wednesday of the previous week.
    2. You will be paid pro rata as follows: the number of days you have worked each month will be divided by the number of weekdays (Monday to Friday) in the same month, the resulting fraction will be multiplied by one twelfth of the equivalent full time annual salary to give the amount of pay you are entitled to in that month.

8. ### Fixed part-time staff
    1. If your pay is specified as being "fixed part time" then you will work for a set number of days per week to be agreed at the commencement of this contract.
    2. You will be paid pro rata as follows: the number of days you work each week will be divided by five, the resulting fraction will be multiplied by one twelfth of the equivalent full time annual salary to give the amount of pay you are entitled to each month.

9. ### Probationary period
    1. You will be subject to an initial four month probationary period.
    2. If at the conclusion of your probationary period dxw cyber requires more time to assess your performance, your probationary period may be extended by a further two months.

10. ### Dismissal without notice
    1. dxw cyber may dismiss you with immediate effect, without notice and with no obligation to make further payments (other than those accrued at the date of termination) if you:

    2. the following is an indicative, non-exhaustive list of things that might constitute gross misconduct:
        1. insubordination;
        2. committing an unlawful act or being convicted for a criminal offence that impacts on your employment;
        3. serious incapability at work brought on by alcohol or illegal drugs;
        4. accepting or offering a bribe or other secret payment;

        10. persistent offensive, intimidating or humiliating behaviour which attempts to undermine an individual or a group of employees;
        11. a serious failure to abide by dxw cyber's values, policies or general duties.

11. ### Notice period
    1. In cases of gross misconduct, you may be dismissed without notice.
    2. Other than in cases of gross misconduct, your notice period:
        1. during your probationary period is two weeks;
        2. following your probationary period up to the second anniversary of your commencement date is six weeks;
        3. after the second anniversary of your commencement date, six weeks plus an additional week for each year of service up to a maximum of 12 weeks.
    3. These periods apply to both you and dxw cyber, irrespective of who is giving notice to whom.
    4. Notice will only be effective if given in writing.
    5. Once notice has been given (whether from you to us, or from us to you), we reserve the right, at any time after the notice was given while you are still employed with us, to give you pay in lieu of notice. This means that we will pay you, as a lump sum, the salary that would otherwise be payable to you during the unexpired portion of your notice period.

12. ### Garden Leave and suspension
    1. Following service of notice by you or by dxw cyber to terminate your employment, dxw cyber reserves the right to put you on Garden Leave, which is a period of time where you shall not perform any services (or perform only specified services) for dxw cyber until the termination of your employment on a specified date.
    2.  During any period of Garden Leave, dxw cyber will not be obliged to provide any work to you, and you will have no right to perform any services for dxw cyber or its’ clients.
    3. During any period of Garden Leave, you will:
        1. continue to receive your salary and all contractual benefits in the usual way and subject to the terms of any benefit arrangement. During periods of Garden Leave, any accrued but unused holiday entitlement shall be deemed to have been taken during your period of Garden Leave;
        2. remain an employee of dxw cyber and bound by the terms of this agreement, particularly in relation to any duties of confidentiality and fidelity;
        3. not, without the prior consent of the managing director, attend your place of work or any other premises of dxw cyber or its’ clients;
        4. ensure that a nominated person at dxw cyber knows where you will be and how you can be contacted.
    4. dxw cyber may suspend all or any of your duties for such period and on such terms as it considers appropriate, including a requirement that you will not attend at dxw cyber’s offices or contact any of its clients, suppliers or staff. dxw cyber can exercise this right at any time (including during a period of notice terminating your employment) and whether or not it is in connection with a disciplinary investigation.

13. ### Holiday entitlement
    1. We operate a holiday year which runs from 1st July to 30th June in the following year.
    2. Leave accrues throughout the year according to the formula given below, resulting in 33 days paid leave for full time staff and a pro rata proportion for those working part time.
    3. Unless notified otherwise you will be required to take all Bank Holidays and Public Holidays as leave and those days are counted in the total of 33 days.
    4. You may carry over a maximum of five days' leave from one holiday year to the next.
    5. At any time in a leave year, your accrued leave entitlement may be calculated as follows: 2.08 x Number of days worked in the year to date / 21.75
    6. The amount of leave you may take will be the total leave accrued, rounded up to the nearest half a day, minus any leave you have already taken in the leave year.
    7. We will usually permit you to take up to five days leave in advance of it being accrued.
    8. If you wish to take leave, you must obtain approval (which will not be unreasonably withheld) and give notice of:
        1. 28 days for a period of leave longer than two days;
        2. seven days for a period of two days or less.
    9. When your employment ends:
        1. If you have accrued leave which you have not taken, you will receive a payment in lieu.
        2. If you have taken more leave than you have accrued, we will deduct an amount from any payment due from us to you on the termination of your employment or, if this is insufficient, we will require you to make up any shortfall.
        3. dxw cyber will calculate the amount of this payment or deduction by multiplying the number of accrued or additional days of holiday by 1/260th of your salary.

14. ### Incapacity
    1. Incapacity means any sickness, injury or other medical condition which prevents the Employee from carrying out their duties.
    2. If you are absent due to incapacity, you must inform dxw cyber by 10:00 on the day of your absence.
    3. dxw cyber will pay your normal salary for up to ten days of incapacity per year.
    4. Pension contributions will continue as normal while you are paid at your normal salary. If your pay during any period of incapacity absence, or if you are paid Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) only, the level of contributions made may change, depending on the Aviva pension scheme rules in force at the time.
    5. You agree to consent to medical examination (at dxw cyber's expense) by a doctor nominated by dxw cyber, if we reasonably require you to do so. You agree that any report produced in connection with any such examination may be disclosed to dxw cyber and that we may discuss the contents of the report with the relevant doctor.
