        within the period of time specified in our Service Level Agreement.

    3.  All contact regarding the services dxw digital provides as part of this

    4.  You understand that any contact you make with us that is not via a
        Support Ticket may be overlooked or disregarded and that any
        consequent failure on our part to respond to you or to take or not take
        some action will not be a breach of this contract.

        are experiencing a problem that meets the criteria for an
        emergency as described in the Service Level Agreement.

        do not create an Emergency Support Ticket, our response time
        may be considerably increased and your service may be disrupted
        for a longer period as a result.


8. ### Time allowance

    1.  dxw digital's initial fee for support is calculated from the
        Time Allowance, which is based on our assessment of your website's
        likely support requirements, as stated in the proposal.

    2.  dxw digital will track time spent providing the services specified in this
        contract in sufficient detail to be able to provide an approximation
        of the time required to service your website in any given month.

    3.  In any given month, dxw digital will carry out all of the services provided
        under this contract with no additional fee, provided that the Time
        Allowance has not been exceeded.

    4.  In any given month, if dxw digital chooses to complete work in excess of the
        Time Allowance, no additional fee will be payable. Any such work is
        completed at dxw digital's absolute discretion and the fact that dxw digital does so on
        one occasion will not imply that dxw digital will do so on subsequent occasions.

    5.  In any given month, if dxw digital chooses not to complete work in excess of
        the Time Allowance, we may notify you, and, subject to our availability,
        will complete that work if dxw digital's fees for the additional work are paid.
        dxw digital will not charge a fee for any such work without your authorisation.

    6.  The Time Allowance may be varied by agreement, and with a corresponding
        change to dxw digital's fees.

    7.  dxw digital will not ordinarily agree to a reduction in the Time Allowance if
        to do so would impede our ability to provide services under this agreement
        to a professional standard.

    8.  If your Time Allowance is regularly exceeded, or almost exceeded, dxw digital
        may notify you that this is the case, and request that the Time
        Allowance be increased.

    9.  If you do not agree to increase the Time Allowance, dxw digital may require
        you to reduce the workload that your website generates; for example, by
        submitting fewer Support Tickets or carrying out remedial development work
        at your own cost.

    10. The Time Allowance is calculated per month. Unused time is not carried
        over and may not be used in any subsequent month.

    11. dxw digital may, for a fee, be able to advise you on alternative approaches
        to managing your website that could reduce your operational costs.

    12. The Time Allowance will have no bearing on dxw digital's provision of the
        services detailed in clauses 4.1.1, 4.1.2 and 4.1.3.





10. ### Suspension

    1.  dxw digital may suspend the services provided as part of this agreement if:

        1.  You fail to pay invoices whose total value is greater than or equal
            to our total fee for the preceding two months' usage of the container hosting service;
        2.  As a last resort, it is necessary for us to do so in order to
            protect your data or another user's security, or to protect
            other users of the internet.

    2.  In the event that the services are suspended, dxw digital will replace your
        website with a message stating that your website is down for maintenance.


11. ### Required Materials

    1.  In order to resolve Support Tickets, there will occasionally be
        Required Materials that you must provide.
    2.  You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
        practical.
    3.  If work on a Support Ticket cannot take place without Required
        Materials, we will suspend work on that ticket.


12. ### Quality

    1.  dxw digital will deliver work of a professional standard.
    2.  dxw digital is insured against professional negligence to a value of £2,000,000.


13. ### Limitation of liability

    1.  dxw digital cannot guarantee perfect reliability.
    2.  dxw digital will deliver work that is as robust and reliable as is reasonably
        practical.
    3.  You acknowledge that all software of non-trivial size contains bugs,
        including security vulnerabilities, and that it is not reasonably
        practical to deliver bug-free software.
    4.  dxw digital will not be liable for any loss of profits or reputation that you
        suffer, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of any failure of the hosting infrastructure.
    5.  You agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that you put
        in place measures that make you able to operate in the event of
        any such failure. dxw digital can work with you to design or implement
        such measures at your request for an agreed fee.
    6.  Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
        liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.
    7.  In any event, dxw digital's total liability under this agreement is
        limited to the lesser of:

        1. The total fees for a year of the service;
        2. The insured sum.

    1.  dxw digital believe that it is best to be open.

            strategy or policy announcements;
        2.  Personal data dxw digital acquires during the course of hosting your
            website;
        3.  The content or existence of any document you send to us that
