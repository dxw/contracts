1. ### Parties

    1.  This agreement is between The Dextrous Web Ltd, a company
        registered in England and Wales under number 6617101, trading as
        "dxw", and the organisation or person specified on the order
        summary accompanying this document.

2. ### Definitions

    Work
    :   The Work is a specific set of activities (carried out by dxw for
        a fee) with a tangible outcome.

    Feedback Period
    :   The Feedback Period is the amount of staff time available to make
        small changes and amendments to the Work after we believe it is
        complete.

    Required Materials
    :   Required Materials are things that dxw needs in order to
        complete the Work or part of it, including but not limited
        to images, text content, licences, consents, or clear
        instructions.

3. ### Proposal

    1.  Before starting the Work, dxw will provide a proposal.
    2.  The proposal dxw provides will contain:

        1.  A description of the Work;
        2.  An indication of when the Work will begin and end;
        3.  An estimate of how much staff time the Work will require;
        4.  Our fees;
        5.  Any other information that we have agreed must be recorded
            and agreed prior to the commencement of the Work.

4. ### The Work

    1.  dxw will complete the Work as described in the proposal.
    3.  At any time, you may request that some aspect of the Work
        be changed. dxw will make reasonable efforts to comply
        with that request.
    3.  If the Work changes, dxw may charge additional fees. We will
        agree any such fees with you before proceeding further with
        the Work.
    4.  When we believe the Work has been completed, we will show you
        the Work, and ask for your feedback.
    5.  If you send us feedback, we will (at no extra charge) spend
        more time on the Work, up to a maximum of 15% of the staff
        time estimated in the proposal.
    6.  If you require further changes after this time has been spent,
        dxw will provide a proposal for a new piece of Work.

5. ### Required Materials

    1.  In order to complete the Work, there will occasionally be
        Required Materials that you must provide.
    2.  You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
        practical.
    3.  If dxw does not have the Required Materials promptly, we may
        not be able to complete the Work within the deadlines specified
        in the proposal.

6. ### Subcontracting

    1.  At dxw's sole discretion, freelancers or contractors may be used
        in place of dxw employees in order to complete some or all of the Work.
    2.  dxw will not outsource the Work without your prior agreement, which
        must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

7. ### Quality

    1.  dxw will deliver the Work to a professional standard.
    2.  dxw is insured against professional negligence to a value of
        £1,000,000 (the "insured sum"). We would be willing to negotiate an
        increase in the insured sum on condition that we were able to pass
        on any corresponding increase in the premium.

8. ### Limitation of liability

    1.  dxw cannot guarantee perfect reliability.
    2.  dxw will deliver Work that is as robust and reliable as is
        reasonably practical.
    4.  dxw will not be liable for any loss of profits or reputation
        that you suffer, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of the Work.
    5.  You agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that you put
        in place measures that make you able to operate in the event of
        any such failure. dxw can work with you to design or implement
        such measures at your request for an agreed fee.
    6.  Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
        liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.
    7.  In any event, dxw's total liability under this agreement is
        limited to the lesser of:

        1. The fee for the Work.

        along with your name or logos on a dxw website or within
        other promotional material. To the extent that these materials are owned by
