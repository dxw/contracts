3. ### The Work

    1.	dxw cyber will provide the Team for the period of time specified in the Order Summary to undertake the Work in return for payment by you of the Fees.

    2. 	The Goals represent our best understanding of the purpose for and desired results of the Work, at the date of the Order Summary.

    3.  If, at any time during the Work, the Goals you wish to address change materially, you must notify us, and new Goals must be agreed in writing.

    4.  If the Goals are changed during the work, dxw cyber reserve the right to provide a new Order Summary, with different Fees payable for the Work. Our agreement to the updated Goals will be contingent on your acceptance of any associated change in Fees.

    5.  dxw cyber may review and revise the Fees associated with the Order Summary annually on anniversary of the commencement date.  Where this happens, dxw cyber will send you an updated Order Summary.

    6.  The Order Summary is not a specification nor a commitment to produce specific deliverables; it is a commitment to provide the Team for the amount of time defined in the Order Summary.

    7.  dxw cyber does not guarantee that the Goals of the Work will be achieved.


4. ### General enquiries

    1.  Where the duration of the Work is more than one month and involves the payment of a regular monthly fee, you may contact us as necessary with enquiries or questions of a general security nature.

    2.  As far as is practical, we will give advice or comments that we hope may be of assistance at no additional cost.

    3.  This provision does not apply where the giving of advice or comments to a professional standard requires background research, analysis, discussion or specialist guidance.

    4.  Our ability and capacity to be able to respond to general enquiries will vary depending on our workload. We are not able to guarantee any particular speed of response or level of service.


5. ### Scope of work

    1.  Prior to the commencement of any practical security testing that may form part of the Work, the parties must agree in writing to a scope for the testing (the "Scope").

    2.  The Scope will list the hosts (the “Hosts”) against which dxw cyber is authorised to perform practical security testing as part of the Work.

    3.  During the Work, either party may request amendments to the Scope.

    4. Changes to the Scope will not affect the amount of time the Team spend on the Work nor the fees due for the Work.  However, both parties acknowledge that prompt agreement to changes to the Scope is necessary for the Goals to be met and that unnecessary narrowing of the scope or other restrictions placed on the practical security testing increase the risk that the Goals will not be achieved.


6. ### Consent to practical security testing

    1.  dxw cyber may, where the acts are lawful without your consent or where the acts are sufficiently routine in nature that consent can be implied, carry out practical security testing, research and analysis relating to information or programs from, on or about any of your Hosts.  Such acts might include (but are not limited to) examining publicly available open source intelligence regarding the Hosts, such as DNS records and SSL certificates or making routine SMTP, HTTP or HTTPS requests to the Hosts.

    2.  dxw cyber will not perform any practical security testing that would otherwise be unlawful without your consent in the form of the Scope.

    3.  In respect of the Hosts set out in the Scope, you authorise dxw cyber to:

        1. Access or modify programs and data on the Hosts, which may include Personal Data;
        2. Perform actions on the hosts which may impair their operation, prevent or hinder access by other users, or impair the operation of programs that run on them;
        3. Intercept or modify communications to and from the hosts or between any other Hosts on a network to which any of the hosts are connected;
        4. Make false or misleading representations to your employees as part of the Work, and you acknowledge and agree that the intent of these statements is not malicious but instead is to make assessments of your security;

    4.  At the conclusion of testing, dxw cyber will, as far as is reasonably practical, ensure each Host subjected to testing is restored to a state substantially similar to that in which it was found at the start of testing.


7. ### Data protection

    1.	In this clause:

        1. Data Protection Legislation means the UK Data Protection Legislation and (for so long as and to the extent that the law of the European Union has legal effect in the UK) the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) and any other directly applicable European Union regulation relating to privacy.

        2. UK Data Protection Legislation means any data protection legislation from time to time in force in the UK including the Data Protection Act 1998 or 2018 or any successor legislation.

        3. All references to Personal Data in this section are specific to Personal Data that we access from your Hosts or that is given to us by you to support or enable practical security testing.

        4. Other Personal Data, such as the records we maintain about your staff, are processed in order to perform our obligations under our agreement, in accordance with our Privacy Policy as published on our website and amended from time to time.

    2.	You recognise and agree that, as part of undertaking the Work, dxw cyber may:

        1.	incidentally access Personal Data that is present on one or more of the Hosts;

        3.	need to include limited amounts of Personal Data in its reports to you as part of describing any vulnerabilities or other findings which were identified during carrying out the Work;

    3.  dxw cyber shall delete any Personal Data under sub-clause 2 above within 90 days of termination of this agreement, save that dxw cyber shall be permitted to:

        1.	retain hashed or encrypted passwords and their plaintext equivalents (but not associated usernames) indefinitely for the purpose of security research, the same not constituting Personal Data under the Data Protection Legislation;
        2.	retain a copy of any reports prepared for you as part of the Work, which may incidentally contain Personal Data.

    4.	In respect of Personal Data:

        1.	Both parties will comply with all applicable requirements of the Data Protection Legislation.

        2.	The parties acknowledge that for the purposes of the Data Protection Legislation, you are the data controller and dxw cyber is the data processor (where Data Controller and Data Processor have the meanings as defined in the Data Protection Legislation).

        3.	Without prejudice to the generality of sub-clause 1 above, you will ensure that you have all necessary  lawful bases, consents and notices in place to enable lawful transfer of the Personal Data to dxw cyber for the duration and purposes of this agreement.

            2.	ensure that we have in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing of Personal Data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, Personal Data, appropriate to the harm that might result from the unauthorised or unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage and the nature of the data to be protected, having regard to the state of technological development and the cost of implementing any measures;
            3.	ensure that all personnel who have access to and/or process Personal Data are obliged to keep the Personal Data confidential; and
            4.	not transfer any Personal Data outside of the European Economic Area in the absence of adequate safeguards or a Commission decision;
            5.	assist you, at your cost, in responding to any request from a Data Subject and in ensuring compliance with your obligations under the Data Protection Legislation with respect to security, breach notifications, impact assessments and consultations with supervisory authorities or regulators;
            6.	notify you without undue delay on becoming aware of a Personal Data breach;
            7.	at your written direction, delete or return Personal Data and copies thereof to you on termination of the agreement unless required by applicable law to store the Personal Data; and
            8.	maintain complete and accurate records and information to demonstrate its compliance with this clause.

    2.  You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably practical.  If you are unable or unwilling to provide such Required Materials, you acknowledge that it may not be possible to complete all or part of the Work, nor to achieve the Goals, but this will not affect the fees due under this agreement which will still be payable by you.
