# Terms of service for technical work

## 23rd May 2018

1. ### Parties

    1.  This agreement is between The Dextrous Web Ltd, a company
        registered in England and Wales under number 6617101, trading as
        "dxw", and the organisation or person specified on the order
        summary accompanying this document.

2. ### Definitions

    Sprint
    :   A Sprint is dxw's basic unit of work. A Sprint consists of
        the services of a dxw team for a set period of time (usually
        two weeks), and any Surrounding Activities you require.

    Acceptance Criteria
    :   Acceptance Criteria are a collection of statements about the 
        functionality of a service which must be true in order for 
        the User Story to be Done. 

    Backlog
    :   The Backlog is a prioritised list of User Stories.

    Done
    :   A Story is Done when its Acceptance Criteria have been met.

    Product
    :   A collection of services and software which, when operational,
        will meet the goals specified in your Project Description.

    Project Description
    :   A Project Description is a written explanation of your Project's
        goals and vision, the user needs you are trying to meet and the nature of 
        the work that you expect will be required to achieve those
        needs and goals.

    Project
    :   A Project is a series of Sprints used to complete work that will
        meet a specified set of goals.

    Reject, Rejected
    :   If you believe a Story's implementation has not met its Acceptance
        Criteria, you can Reject it, in which case, it becomes Rejected.

    Required Materials
    :   Required Materials are things that dxw needs in order to
        complete a particular piece of work, including but not limited
        to content, licences, consents, or clear instructions.

    Sprints Estimate
    :   The approximate number of Sprints dxw estimates will be required
        to deliver a Product, as specified in the Project Description.
        Generally expressed as a range; for example: "Between X and Y sprints".
        These numbers are estimates, and are not binding.

    Started
    :   A User Story has been Started when dxw has started its implementation.

    User Story
    :   A User Story is a description of some work to be completed. In order
        for a User Story to be considered "ready" to be worked on, it must:
        specify a user need; identify the user who has the need; and
        describe some behaviour which, having been implemented, will meet
        that need. It should include a list of Acceptance Criteria. 

    Surrounding Activities
    :   Surrounding Activities are services other than the implementation
        of Stories which dxw provides as part of a Sprint; for example: assisting
        you with roadmapping, the definition and prioritisation of User Stories 
        at the start of the Project, discovery and user research work, penetration 
        testing or product strategy.

3. ### Proposal

    1.  Before starting a Project, dxw will provide a proposal.
    2.  The proposal dxw provides will contain:

        1.  The initial Project Description;
        2.  A recommendation for what work should take place in the 
            Sprints, its Surrounding Activities and the makeup of the team
            working on the Project;
        3.  Our fees, including a per-Sprint fee (based on the recommended
            Sprint shape) and our fees for any Surrounding Activities;
        4.  An indication of when dxw is available to start the work and
            a Sprints Estimate;
        5.  Any other information that we have agreed must be recorded
            and agreed prior to the commencement of the Project.

    3. 	Any Project Description that we provide will represent our best
        understanding of the work that you require to be completed as
        part of the Project, at the time it was written.
    4.  At any time during a Project if the goals or user needs that your
        project is addressing change substantially, you must tell us,
        and a new Project Description must be agreed in writing.
    5.  If the Project Description is changed during the Project, dxw may
        provide a new Sprints Estimate.
    6.  Neither the Project Description nor the proposal is a
        specification and neither commit us to providing any particular
        features or deliverables, other than the provision of Sprints.

4. ### Sprints

    1.  dxw will deliver a number of Sprints in order to do work that will
        meet your goals and users' needs.
    2.  Initially, dxw will deliver Sprints with the structure agreed in
        the proposal.
    3.  At any time, you may request that the makeup of the team be changed. 
        Subject to our availability and your acceptance of a revised 
        per-sprint fee, we dxw will accommodate such requests.
    4.  At the beginning of the Project, we will work with you (as a Surrounding Activity) to
        define an initial set of User Stories for implementation. This list
        of Stories forms the Project's Backlog.
    5.  At the beginning of each Sprint, we will work with you in a planning
        meeting to prioritise the UserStories in the Backlog and agree what will
        be worked on in the Sprint.
    6.  At any time, you may add User Stories to the Backlog.
    7.  At any time, you may change the priority of Stories in the Backlog.
    8.  During each Sprint, dxw will work on User Stories, starting with
        the most important User Story in the Backlog.
    9.  At the beginning of each Sprint, dxw will give an indication of
        the number of User Stories dxw expects to be able to complete during
        the Sprint. This indication is not binding. The number of
        User Stories completed in each Sprint will vary depending on the 
        complexity of the work.
    10. A User Story cannot be Started unless:

        1.  It is ready (see clause 2.12);
        2.  It has agreed Acceptance Criteria;
        3.  All Required Materials for the User Story's implementation have
            been provided to us.

    11. After a User Story has been Started:

        1.  You must not change the User Story without dxw's prior agreement;
        2.  You may instruct us to cease work on the User Story;
        3.  We will make reasonable efforts to complete the User Story
            within the Sprint.

    12. After dxw believe a User Story is Done:

        1.  dxw will make it available to you for you to test and
            review;
        2.  You must Accept the story as soon as you are reasonably able
            to do so, and in any case, no later than the end of the
            Sprint;
        3.  You must not Reject the User Story unless it has not met its
            Acceptance Criteria;
        4.  If you Reject a User Story, it will be returned to the Backlog for
            you to prioritise;
        4.  If you Reject a User Story near the end of a Sprint, we may not be
            able to complete it until the next Sprint;
        5.  If having tested the User Story's implementation you decide that
            its functionality should be materially different from the
            Acceptance Criteria, you must make a new User Story describing
            the changes you require, and a new list of Acceptance Criteria must be
            agreed.

5. ### Sprint fees, estimates and administration

    1.  If you accept our proposal, dxw will provide an order summary
        detailing:

        1.  A total cost and cost breakdown of a Sprint and summary of
            its structure, including the people working on the sprint
            and how many days they'll be working;
        2.  The start and end dates of all Sprints;
        3.  A list of the Surrounding Activities you have told us you
            would like us to undertake, and the associated costs;
        4.  Contact details for members of dxw's staff who you may need
            to contact, including an escalation contact.

    2.  At any time, you may request further Sprints. Subject to our
        availability, dxw will make reasonable efforts to schedule
        Sprints at a time that is convenient to you.
    3.  Whenever further Sprints are requested, dxw will provide an
        further order summary for those Sprints.
    4.  Upon your acceptance of an order summary, the specified Sprints
        will be booked.
    5.  If you cancel a Sprint which has been booked, a cancellation fee
        will immediately become payable. The cancellation fee is 50% of
        the cost of the Sprint.
    6.  If the number of sprints delivered reaches the maximum limit in
        the Sprints Estimate and the Product falls materially short of
        the standard specified in the Project Description ("Unacceptable"),
        dxw will discount the cost of further sprints by 30%.
    7.  As soon as the Product is no longer Unacceptable, the 30%
        discount will not apply.
    8.  dxw reserves the right not to provide discounted Sprints if:

        1.  The Product is Unacceptable in part or in whole because of your
            failure to "engage" (see "Engagement" below); or
        2.  You have breached the terms of this agreement.

6. ### Required Materials

    1.  In order to complete User Stories, there will occasionally be
        Required Materials that you must provide.
    2.  You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
        practical.
    3.  If dxw does not have the Required Materials in time to start a
        particular User Story, we will move on to the next User Story 
        in the Backlog. This may cause a User Story not to be delivered in the
        Sprint you have specified.

7. ### Engagement

    1.  It is essential that you fully engage with the development process in
        order for the Project to be completed successfully. In this context "engage"
        includes promptly:

        1.  Participating actively in the work, particularly in sprint planning,
            retrospective sessions and stand-ups;
        2.  Responding to our questions and providing advice;
        2.  Providing feedback, Rejecting and Accepting Stories promptly;
        3.  Supplying to us any Required Materials;
        4.  Telling us about any problems that could affect delivery.

8. ### Subcontracting

    1.  At dxw's sole discretion, contractors may be used
        in place of dxw employees in order to complete Sprints or
        Surrounding Activities.
    2.  Wherever contractors are used, they will work under
        our direction.
    3.  dxw will not outsource any Sprint or Surrounding Activity
        without your prior agreement, which must not be unreasonably
        withheld or delayed.

9. ### Quality

    1.  dxw will deliver work of a professional standard.
    2.  dxw will deliver code that is as free of bugs and security
        vulnerabilities as is reasonably practical.
    3.  dxw is insured against professional negligence to a value of
        £2,000,000 (the "insured sum"). dxw is willing to negotiate
        an increase in the insured sum on condition that we were able to
        pass on any corresponding increase in the premium.

10. ### Limitation of liability

    1.  dxw cannot guarantee perfect reliability.
    2.  dxw will deliver work that is as robust and reliable as is
        reasonably practical.
    3.  You acknowledge that all software of non-trivial size contains bugs,
        including security vulnerabilities, and that it is not
        reasonably practical to deliver bug-free software.
    4.  dxw will not be liable for any loss of profits or reputation
        that you suffer, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of any
        failure of the Product.
    5.  You agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that you put
        in place measures that make you able to operate in the event of
        any such failure. dxw can work with you to design or implement
        such measures at your request as a Surrounding Activity.
    6.  Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
        liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.
    7.  In any event, dxw's total liability under this agreement is
        limited to the lesser of:

        1. The total fee for the Project.
        2. The insured sum.

11. ### Confidentiality

    1.  dxw believe that it is best to be open.
    2.  dxw will generally not keep the details of your project
        confidential, including by not limited to:

        1.  The fact that dxw has a commercial relationship with you;
        2.  The nature and goals of your Project;
        3.  Your Project's likely completion date(s);
        4.  Our fee for your Project.

    3.  However, dxw will keep confidential:

        1.  The specific content of documents or copy that will be
            published on any of your websites that is not yet publicly
            available, especially the content of forthcoming
            strategy or policy announcements;
        2.  Personal data dxw acquires during the course of the Project;
        3.  The content or existence of any document you send to us that
            is protectively marked.

    4.  If you have additional confidentiality requirements, you must tell
        us in writing as soon as is reasonably practical.

12. ### Intellectual property

    1.  Intellectual property in work created by us in the course of working on
        a Story and that also forms a part of the Product ("Project IP") shall,
        (as a future assignment of intellectual property) belong to you, subject
        to the licence back set out in this agreement.
    2.  "Background IP" means any intellectual property used in the Product that
        is not Project IP and "Reused IP" means any Background IP which we own.
    3.  You do not become the owner of any Background IP.
    4.  We grant you a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence
        to the Reused IP for their use in the Product.

        for use of the Project IP in any Product created by dxw, including the
        right to licence the use of the Project IP in any Product ("the licence
        back").
    6.  We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that Background IP that is
        not Reused IP is licensed in such a way that you are able to make use of
        it as part of the Product.
    8.  dxw may place links or representative screenshots of the materials we create
        for our clients along with their names or logos on a dxw website or within
        other promotional material. To the extent that these materials are owned by
        you, you agree to grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive,
        royalty-free licence that authorises this use.
    10. We are neither able to enumerate the intellectual property your Product
        contains, nor to state which parts are owned by you and which are Project
        IP or Reused IP.

        issued, dxw may charge an additional fee.

14. ### Circumstances beyond our control

    1.  dxw will not be liable for any failure caused by industrial
        action or other circumstances beyond our reasonable control.

15. ### Changes to these terms

    1.  dxw may vary these terms at any time upon giving you prior
        written notice.
    2.  If any proposed change in these terms puts you at a material
        disadvantage you may send us a written objection, in which case,
        the change will not be binding on you.
    3.  Any such written objection must be sent within 14 days of the
        the notice dxw sends you.
    4.  This clause does not apply if it would violate the terms of a

        interpretation of this agreement.

19. ### Whole agreement

    1.  With the exception of any framework agreement of which this agreement forms a part,
        this agreement and the order summary that accompanies it constitute the entire
