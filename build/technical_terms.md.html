    <h3 id="parties">Parties</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>This agreement is between The Dextrous Web Ltd, a company
registered in England and Wales under number 6617101, trading as
“dxw digital”, and the organisation or person specified on the order
summary accompanying this document.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt>Sprint</dt>
      <dd>A Sprint is dxw’s basic unit of work. A Sprint consists of
the services of a dxw team for a set period of time (usually
two weeks), and any Surrounding Activities you require.</dd>
      <dt>Acceptance Criteria</dt>
      <dd>Acceptance Criteria are a collection of statements about the
functionality of a User Story which must be true in order for
the User Story to be Done.</dd>
      <dt>Backlog</dt>
      <dd>The Backlog is a prioritised list of User Stories.</dd>
      <dt>Done</dt>
      <dd>A Story is Done when its Acceptance Criteria have been met.</dd>
      <dt>Product</dt>
      <dd>A collection of services and software which, when operational,
will meet the goals specified in your Project Description.</dd>
      <dt>Project Description</dt>
      <dd>A Project Description is a written explanation of your Project’s
goals and vision, the user needs you are trying to meet and the nature of
the work that you expect will be required to meet those needs and achieve
those goals.</dd>
      <dt>Project</dt>
      <dd>A Project is a series of Sprints used to complete work that will
meet a specified set of goals.</dd>
      <dt>Reject, Rejected</dt>
      <dd>If you believe a Story’s implementation has not met its Acceptance
Criteria, you can Reject it, in which case, it becomes Rejected.</dd>
      <dt>Required Materials</dt>
      <dd>Required Materials are things that dxw digital needs in order to
complete a particular piece of work, including but not limited
to content, licences, consents, or clear instructions.</dd>
      <dt>Sprints Estimate</dt>
      <dd>The approximate number of Sprints dxw digital estimates will be required
to deliver a Product, as specified in the Project Description.
Generally expressed as a range; for example: “Between X and Y sprints”.
These numbers are estimates, and are not binding.</dd>
      <dt>Started</dt>
      <dd>A User Story has been Started when dxw digital has started its implementation.</dd>
      <dt>User Story</dt>
      <dd>A User Story is a description of some work to be completed. In order
for a User Story to be considered “ready” to be worked on, it must:
specify a user need; identify the user who has the need; and
describe some behaviour which, having been implemented, will meet
that need. It should include a list of Acceptance Criteria.</dd>
      <dt>Surrounding Activities</dt>
      <dd>Surrounding Activities are services other than the implementation
of Stories which dxw digital provides as part of a Sprint; for example: assisting
you with roadmapping, the definition and prioritisation of User Stories
at the start of the Project, discovery and user research work, penetration
testing or product strategy.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="proposal">Proposal</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Before starting a Project, dxw digital will provide a proposal.</li>
      <li>
        <p>The proposal dxw digital provides will contain:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The initial Project Description;</li>
          <li>A recommendation for what work should take place in the
Sprints, its Surrounding Activities and the makeup of the team
working on the Project;</li>
          <li>Our fees, including a per-Sprint fee (based on the recommended
Sprint work) and our fees for any Surrounding Activities;</li>
          <li>An indication of when dxw digital is available to start the work and
a Sprints Estimate;</li>
          <li>Any other information that we have agreed must be recorded
and agreed prior to the commencement of the Project.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Any Project Description that we provide will represent our best
     understanding of the work that you require to be completed as
     part of the Project, at the time it was written.</li>
      <li>At any time during a Project if the goals or user needs that your
project is addressing change substantially, you must tell us,
and a new Project Description must be agreed in writing.</li>
      <li>If the Project Description is changed during the Project, dxw digital may
provide a new Sprints Estimate.</li>
      <li>Neither the Project Description nor the proposal is a
specification and neither commit us to providing any particular
features or deliverables, other than the provision of Sprints.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="sprints">Sprints</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>dxw digital will deliver a number of Sprints in order to do work that will
meet your goals and users’ needs.</li>
      <li>Initially, dxw digital will deliver Sprints with the structure agreed in
the proposal.</li>
      <li>At any time, you may request that the makeup of the team be changed.
Subject to our availability and your acceptance of a revised
per-sprint fee, dxw digital will accommodate such requests.</li>
      <li>At the beginning of the Project, we will work with you (as a Surrounding Activity) to
define an initial set of User Stories for implementation. This list
of Stories forms the Project’s Backlog.</li>
      <li>At the beginning of each Sprint, we will work with you in a planning
meeting to prioritise the User Stories in the Backlog and agree what will
be worked on in the Sprint.</li>
      <li>At any time, you may add User Stories to the Backlog.</li>
      <li>At any time, you may change the priority of Stories in the Backlog.</li>
      <li>During each Sprint, dxw digital will work on User Stories, starting with
the most important User Story in the Backlog.</li>
      <li>At the beginning of each Sprint, dxw digital will give an indication of
the number of User Stories dxw expects to be able to complete during
the Sprint. This indication is not binding. The number of
User Stories completed in each Sprint will vary depending on the
complexity of the work.</li>
      <li>
        <p>A User Story cannot be Started unless:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>It is ready (see clause 2.12);</li>
          <li>It has agreed Acceptance Criteria;</li>
          <li>All Required Materials for the User Story’s implementation have
been provided to us.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After a User Story has been Started:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>You must not change the User Story without dxw digital’s prior agreement;</li>
          <li>You may instruct us to cease work on the User Story;</li>
          <li>We will make reasonable efforts to complete the User Story
within the Sprint.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After dxw digital believe a User Story is Done:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>dxw digital will make it available to you for you to test and
review;</li>
          <li>You must Accept the story as soon as you are reasonably able
to do so, and in any case, no later than the end of the
Sprint;</li>
          <li>You must not Reject the User Story unless it has not met its
Acceptance Criteria;</li>
          <li>If you Reject a User Story, it will be returned to the Backlog for
you to prioritise;</li>
          <li>If you Reject a User Story near the end of a Sprint, we may not be
able to complete it until the next Sprint;</li>
          <li>If having tested the User Story’s implementation you decide that
its functionality should be materially different from the
Acceptance Criteria, you must make a new User Story describing
the changes you require, and a new list of Acceptance Criteria must be
agreed.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="sprint-fees-estimates-and-administration">Sprint fees, estimates and administration</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>If you accept our proposal, dxw digital will provide an order summary
detailing:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>A total cost and cost breakdown of a Sprint and summary of
its structure, including the people working on the sprint
and how many days they’ll be working;</li>
          <li>The start and end dates of all Sprints;</li>
          <li>A list of the Surrounding Activities you have told us you
would like us to undertake, and the associated costs;</li>
          <li>Contact details for members of dxw digital’s staff who you may need
to contact, including an escalation contact.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>At any time, you may request further Sprints. Subject to our
availability, dxw digital will make reasonable efforts to schedule
Sprints at a time that is convenient to you.</li>
      <li>Whenever further Sprints are requested, dxw digital will provide an
further order summary for those Sprints.</li>
      <li>Upon your acceptance of an order summary, the specified Sprints
will be booked.</li>
      <li>If you cancel a Sprint which has been booked, a cancellation fee
will immediately become payable. The cancellation fee is 50% of
the cost of the Sprint.</li>
      <li>If the number of sprints delivered reaches the maximum limit in
the Sprints Estimate and the Product falls materially short of
the standard specified in the Project Description (“Unacceptable”),
dxw digital will discount the cost of further sprints by 30%.</li>
      <li>As soon as the Product is no longer Unacceptable, the 30%
discount will not apply.</li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw digital reserves the right not to provide discounted Sprints if:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The Product is Unacceptable in part or in whole because of your
failure to “engage” (see “Engagement” below); or</li>
          <li>You have breached the terms of this agreement.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

    <ol>
      <li>In order to complete User Stories, there will occasionally be
Required Materials that you must provide.</li>
      <li>You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
practical.</li>
      <li>If dxw digital does not have the Required Materials in time to start a
particular User Story, we will move on to the next User Story
in the Backlog. This may cause a User Story not to be delivered in the
Sprint you have specified.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="engagement">Engagement</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>

    <h3 id="subcontracting">Subcontracting</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>At dxw digital’s sole discretion, contractors may be used
in place of dxw employees in order to complete Sprints or
Surrounding Activities.</li>
      <li>Wherever contractors are used, they will work under
our direction.</li>
      <li>dxw digital will not outsource any Sprint or Surrounding Activity
without your prior agreement, which must not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.</li>
    </ol>

any such failure. dxw digital can work with you to design or implement
such measures at your request as a Surrounding Activity.</li>
      <li>Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.</li>
      <li>
        <p>In any event, dxw digital’s total liability under this agreement is
