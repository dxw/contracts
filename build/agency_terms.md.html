<ol>
  <li>
    <h3 id="parties">Parties</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>This agreement is between The Dextrous Web Ltd, a company
registered in England and Wales under number 6617101, trading as
“dxw”, and the organisation or person specified on the order
summary accompanying this document.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

    <h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt>Sprint</dt>
      <dd>A Sprint is our basic unit of development. A sprint consists of
the services of a given number of developers for a given period
of time, and any Surrounding Activities you require.</dd>
      <dt>Acceptance Criteria</dt>
      <dd>Acceptance Criteria are attributes of the Product, embodied in a document, that a
Story must provide in order for the Story to be considered
Finished.</dd>
      <dt>Backlog</dt>
      <dd>The Backlog is a prioritised list of Stories for implementation
by developers.</dd>
      <dt>Finished</dt>
      <dd>A Story is Finished when its Acceptance Criteria have been met.</dd>
      <dt>Product</dt>
      <dd>The collection of services and software which, when operational,
will meet the goals specified in your Project Description.</dd>
      <dt>Project Description</dt>
      <dd>A Project Description is a written explanation of your Project’s
goals, the user needs you are addressing and the nature of the
functionality that you expect will be required to achieve those
needs and goals.</dd>
      <dt>Project</dt>
      <dd>A Project is a sequence of Sprints used to develop features a
Product.</dd>
      <dt>Reject</dt>
      <dd>A Rejected story is one which, following its implementation, you
do not believe has been Finished.</dd>
      <dt>Required Materials</dt>
      <dd>Required Materials are things that dxw needs in order to
complete a particular piece of work, including but not limited
to images, text content, licences, consents, or clear
instructions.</dd>
      <dt>Sprints Estimate</dt>
      <dd>The number of Sprints dxw estimates will be required to deliver
a Product, as specified in the Project Description. Generally
expressed as a range; for example: “Between X and Y sprints”.
These numbers are estimates, and are not binding.</dd>
      <dt>Started</dt>
      <dd>A Story has been Started when a developer has begun its
implementation.</dd>
      <dt>Story</dt>
      <dd>A Story is a description of some work to be completed. In order
for Story to be considered “ready” for implementation, it must:
specify a user need; identify the user who has the need; and
describe some behaviour that (having been implemented) will meet
that need.</dd>
      <dt>Surrounding Activities</dt>
      <dd>Surrounding Activities are services dxw provides as part of the
Project which are not part of a Sprint; for example: assisting you with the definition and prioritisation of Stories at the start of the Project, user testing
and discovery, penetration testing, research or business
analysis.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="proposal">Proposal</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Before starting a Project, dxw will provide a proposal.</li>
      <li>
        <p>The proposal dxw provides will contain:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The inital Project Description;</li>
          <li>A recommendation for the duration of a Sprint, its
Surrounding Activities and a number of developers;</li>
          <li>Our fees, including a per-Sprint fee (based on the recommended Sprint) and our fees for any Surrounding Activities;</li>
          <li>An indication of when dxw is available to start the work and
a Sprints Estimate;</li>
          <li>Any other information that we have agreed must be recorded
and agreed prior to the commencement of the Project.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Any Project Description that we provide will represent our best
     understanding of the work that you require to be completed as
     part of the Project, at the time it was written.</li>
      <li>At any time during a Project if the goals or user needs that your
project is addressing change substantially, you must tell us,
and a new Project Description must be agreed in writing.</li>
      <li>If the Project Description is changed during the Project, dxw may
provide a new Sprints Estimate.</li>
      <li>Neither the Project Description nor the proposal is a
specification and neither commit us to providing any particular
features or deliverables, other than the provision of Sprints.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="sprints">Sprints</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>dxw will deliver a number of Sprints in order to create a
Product.</li>
      <li>Initially, dxw will deliver Sprints with the structure agreed in
the proposal.</li>
      <li>At any time, you may request that the length of the Sprint or
the number of developers be changed. Subject to our available
resources and your acceptance of a revised per-sprint fee,
we dxw will accommodate such requests.</li>
      <li>At the beginning of the Project, we will work with you (as a Surrounding Activity) to
define an initial set of Stories for implementation. This list
of Stories form the Project’s Backlog.</li>
      <li>At the beginning of each Sprint, we will work with you (as a Surrounding Activity) to
prioritise the Stories in the Backlog and agree Acceptance
Criteria.</li>
      <li>At any time, you may add Stories to the Backlog.</li>
      <li>At any time, you may change the priority of Stories in the Backlog.</li>
      <li>During each Sprint, dxw will implement Stories, starting with
the most important Story in the Backlog.</li>
      <li>At the beginning of each Sprint, dxw will give an indication of
the number of Stories dxw expects to be able to complete during
the Sprint. This indication is not binding. The number of
Stories completed in each Sprint will vary.</li>
      <li>
        <p>A Story cannot be Started unless:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>It is ready (see clause 2.12);</li>
          <li>It has agreed Acceptance Criteria;</li>
          <li>All Required Materials for the Story’s implementation have
been provided to us.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After a Story has been Started:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>You may not change the Story without dxw’s prior consent;</li>
          <li>You may instruct us to cease work on the Story;</li>
          <li>We will make all reasonable efforts, using the resources allocated
to the Sprint, to complete the Story within the Sprint.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After dxw believe a Story has been Finished:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>dxw will make it available to you for your testing and
review;</li>
          <li>You must Accept the story as soon as you are reasonably able
to do so, and in any case, no later than the end of the
Sprint;</li>
          <li>You must not Reject the Story unless it has not met its
Acceptance Criteria;</li>
          <li>If you Reject a Story, it will be returned to the Backlog for
you to prioritise;</li>
          <li>If having tested the Story’s implementation you decide that
its functionality should be materially different from the
Acceptance Criteria, you must make a new Story describing
the changes you require, and new Acceptance Criteria must be
agreed.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="sprint-fees-estimates-and-administration">Sprint fees, estimates and administration</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>If you accept our proposal, dxw will provide an order summary
detailing:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>A total cost and cost breakdown of a Sprint and summary of
its structure;</li>
          <li>The start and end dates of all Sprints that you have told us
you would like to book immediately;</li>
          <li>A list of the Surrounding Activity you have told us you
would like us to undertake, and their associated costs;</li>
          <li>Contact details for members of dxw’s staff who you may need
to contact, including an escalation contact.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>At any time, you may request further Sprints. Subject to our
availability, dxw will make reasonable efforts to schedule
Sprints at a time that is convenient to you.</li>
      <li>Whenever further Sprints are requested, dxw will provide an
additional order summary for those Sprints.</li>
      <li>Upon your acceptance of an order summary, the specified Sprints
will be booked.</li>
      <li>If you cancel a Sprint which has been booked, a cancellation fee
will immediately become payable. The cancellation fee is 35% of
the cost of the Sprint.</li>
      <li>If the upper value in the Sprints Estimate is reached and the
Product falls materially short of the standard specified in the
original Project Description (“Unacceptable”), dxw will discount
the cost of further sprints by 35%.</li>
      <li>As soon as the Product is no longer Unacceptable, no further
discounts will apply.</li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw reserves the right not to provide discounted Sprints if:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The Product is Unacceptable in part or in whole because of your
failure to “engage” (see below); or</li>
          <li>You have breached the terms of this agreement.</li>

practical.</li>
      <li>If dxw does not have the Required Materials in time to start a
particular Story, we will move on to the next Story in the
Backlog. This may cause a Story not to be delivered in the
Sprint you have specified.</li>

    <h3 id="engagement">Engagement</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
