<ol>
  <li>
    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>dxw digital has created this Service Level Agreement to define the minimum
standard of responsiveness that clients can expect from us when using
dxw digital’s helpdesk.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The responsiveness targets given in this agreement are maximal. dxw digital will
make best endeavours to respond to all issues as quickly as possible,
notwithstanding the requirements of this agreement.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="priority">Priority</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>There are four levels of priority that apply to tickets, as described
below.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A ticket’s priority is set by dxw digital, based on our understanding of the
impact and importance of the problem.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Clients are requested to describe the problem and its impact as clearly
as possible, in order to allow us to set priority appropriately.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Tickets are set to Normal priority as a matter of course on receipt.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Tickets sent to support-emergency@dxw.com are set to Urgent priority on
receipt.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The receipt of an Urgent ticket will result in the immediate alerting of
on-call members of staff, no matter the time of day.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Please do not create Urgent tickets unless you are experiencing a genuine
emergency, as defined below.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Use of the emergency support address may be withdrawn from clients who
use it to submit tickets in situations that do not constitute an emergency.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>References to “working” days, hours or minutes refer to dxw digital’s working
hours of 10:00-18:00 Monday-Friday, excluding bank holidays.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The “enhanced” response times apply to tickets raised by customers on our
Managed Plus plan.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="urgent-tickets">Urgent tickets</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Tickets are Urgent if:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The problem they describe relates to a production system which is
completely unavailable, or whose performance is so poor as to render
the service unusable;</li>
          <li>A production system may have been compromised by an attacker and that
the suspected attack or its impact is ongoing.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Urgent tickets must receive a first reply within 1 hour (standard) or 30
minutes (enhanced), at any time of the day or night.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Tickets created by emailing support-emergency@dxw.com are automatically
marked as urgent.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="high-priority-tickets">High priority tickets</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Tickets are high priority if:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The problem they describe relates to a production system which has
stopped performing adequately; and</li>
          <li>That loss in performance is resulting in a serious reduction in the
usability or usefulness of the hosted service.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>“Performance” in this context does not exclusively refer to the speed of
response. It also refers to the correctness of responses. For example,
if an important feature of a site is responsive but has ceased to work
correctly, that is also a loss in performance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>High priority tickets must receive a first reply within 1 working hour
(standard) or 30 working minutes (enhanced).</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="normal-priority-tickets">Normal priority tickets</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Tickets are normal priority if they are not low priority, urgent or critical.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Normal priority tickets must receive a first reply within 8 working hours
(standard) or 4 working hours (enhanced).</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="low-priority">Low priority</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Tickets are low priority if they are:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Background requests for information or offhand enquiries;</li>
          <li>Requests for work where a delay has little or no impact on service.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Low priority tickets must receive initial and subsequent replies within
5 business days.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
