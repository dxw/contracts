          <li>are guilty of gross misconduct affecting dxw cyber’s business;</li>
          <li>commit any serious or repeated breach of this contract or fail to comply with dxw cyber’s reasonable and lawful directions;</li>

        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>the following is an indicative, non-exhaustive list of things that might constitute gross misconduct:

          <li>a serious failure to abide by dxw cyber’s values, policies or general duties.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="notice-period">Notice period</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In cases of gross misconduct, you may be dismissed without notice.</li>
      <li>Other than in cases of gross misconduct, your notice period:
        <ol>
          <li>during your probationary period is two weeks;</li>
          <li>following your probationary period up to the second anniversary of your commencement date is six weeks;</li>

        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>These periods apply to both you and dxw cyber, irrespective of who is giving notice to whom.</li>
      <li>Notice will only be effective if given in writing.</li>
      <li>Once notice has been given (whether from you to us, or from us to you), we reserve the right, at any time after the notice was given while you are still employed with us, to give you pay in lieu of notice. This means that we will pay you, as a lump sum, the salary that would otherwise be payable to you during the unexpired portion of your notice period.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="garden-leave-and-suspension">Garden Leave and suspension</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Following service of notice by you or by dxw cyber to terminate your employment, dxw cyber reserves the right to put you on Garden Leave, which is a period of time where you shall not perform any services (or perform only specified services) for dxw cyber until the termination of your employment on a specified date.</li>
      <li>During any period of Garden Leave, dxw cyber will not be obliged to provide any work to you, and you will have no right to perform any services for dxw cyber or its’ clients.</li>
      <li>During any period of Garden Leave, you will:
        <ol>
          <li>continue to receive your salary and all contractual benefits in the usual way and subject to the terms of any benefit arrangement. During periods of Garden Leave, any accrued but unused holiday entitlement shall be deemed to have been taken during your period of Garden Leave;</li>
          <li>remain an employee of dxw cyber and bound by the terms of this agreement, particularly in relation to any duties of confidentiality and fidelity;</li>
          <li>not, without the prior consent of the managing director, attend your place of work or any other premises of dxw cyber or its’ clients;</li>
          <li>ensure that a nominated person at dxw cyber knows where you will be and how you can be contacted.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>dxw cyber may suspend all or any of your duties for such period and on such terms as it considers appropriate, including a requirement that you will not attend at dxw cyber’s offices or contact any of its clients, suppliers or staff. dxw cyber can exercise this right at any time (including during a period of notice terminating your employment) and whether or not it is in connection with a disciplinary investigation.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="holiday-entitlement">Holiday entitlement</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>We operate a holiday year which runs from 1st July to 30th June in the following year.</li>
      <li>Leave accrues throughout the year according to the formula given below, resulting in 33 days paid leave for full time staff and a pro rata proportion for those working part time.</li>
      <li>Unless notified otherwise you will be required to take all Bank Holidays and Public Holidays as leave and those days are counted in the total of 33 days.</li>
      <li>You may carry over a maximum of five days’ leave from one holiday year to the next.</li>
      <li>At any time in a leave year, your accrued leave entitlement may be calculated as follows: 2.08 x Number of days worked in the year to date / 21.75</li>
      <li>The amount of leave you may take will be the total leave accrued, rounded up to the nearest half a day, minus any leave you have already taken in the leave year.</li>
      <li>We will usually permit you to take up to five days leave in advance of it being accrued.</li>
      <li>If you wish to take leave, you must obtain approval (which will not be unreasonably withheld) and give notice of:
        <ol>
          <li>28 days for a period of leave longer than two days;</li>
          <li>seven days for a period of two days or less.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>When your employment ends:
        <ol>
          <li>If you have accrued leave which you have not taken, you will receive a payment in lieu.</li>
          <li>If you have taken more leave than you have accrued, we will deduct an amount from any payment due from us to you on the termination of your employment or, if this is insufficient, we will require you to make up any shortfall.</li>
          <li>dxw cyber will calculate the amount of this payment or deduction by multiplying the number of accrued or additional days of holiday by 1/260th of your salary.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>

      <li>dxw cyber will pay your normal salary for up to ten days of incapacity per year.</li>
      <li>Pension contributions will continue as normal while you are paid at your normal salary. If your pay during any period of incapacity absence, or if you are paid Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) only, the level of contributions made may change, depending on the Aviva pension scheme rules in force at the time.</li>
      <li>You agree to consent to medical examination (at dxw cyber’s expense) by a doctor nominated by dxw cyber, if we reasonably require you to do so. You agree that any report produced in connection with any such examination may be disclosed to dxw cyber and that we may discuss the contents of the report with the relevant doctor.</li>
