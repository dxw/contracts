    <h3 id="fair-use-of-resources">Fair use of resources</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Where we detect that a service is using an unusually large quantity of compute resources such as CPU time or bandwidth, we may take steps to reduce that usage, including:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Throttling or reducing access to a lower level;</li>
          <li>Blocking access to files, or any other problematic resource;</li>
          <li>In extremis, deleting or otherwise removing content, files, or any other problematic resource.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If we take action as a result of this policy we will, as far as we are reasonably able, take steps to minimise the impact upon your services and work with you to resolve any underlying problem.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You must not use our services to send unsolicited commercial email. Please note that this includes email from public sector bodies, and does not imply that a paid service is being offered or advertised.</p>
