    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>dxw has created this Acceptable Use Policy in order to ensure that all customers understand the ways in which our services may not be used, and the action we make take if this policy is violated.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It is our responsibility to ensure that the services we provide under this policy work optimally for as many customers as possible. We aim to ensure that all customers enjoy uninterrupted service.</p>
      </li>

    <h3 id="uk-law">UK Law</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>This AUP and all of dxw’s services are operated under the legal jurisdiction of England &amp; Wales.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You must not use our services in violation of any applicable law or of any person’s rights under any applicable law. Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>infringing the intellectual property rights of any person;</li>
          <li>storing or disseminating material that is defamatory or otherwise infringes any person’s personality rights;</li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You must take reasonable steps to ensure that no-one who you have permitted to make use of our services (eg visitors to a website) violates any applicable law or any person’s rights under any applicable law and you must impose on such persons an obligation in similar terms as paragraph 2 above.</p>

    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="fair-use-of-resources">Fair use of resources</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>It is important for our service management that the resources you consume are reasonably consistent from month-to-month.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Where we detect that a service is using an unusually large quantity of compute resources such as CPU time or bandwidth, we may take steps to reduce that usage, including:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Throttling or reducing access to a lower level;</li>
          <li>Blocking access to files, or any other problematic resource;</li>
          <li>In extremis, deleting or otherwise removing content, files, or any other problematic resource.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If we take action as a result of this policy we will, as far as we are reasonably able, take steps to minimise the impact upon your services and work with you to resolve any underlying problem.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You must not use our services to send unsolicited commercial email. Please note that “commercial email” includes email from public sector bodies, and does not imply that a paid service is being offered or advertised.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="security">Security</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Any attempt to deliberately breach the security of our systems or to exceed your access privileges is forbidden.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If we detect any such attempt, we may:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Remove your access to any or all dxw services;</li>
          <li>Take whatever steps we consider reasonable to recover from the breach;</li>

        </ol>
      </li>
