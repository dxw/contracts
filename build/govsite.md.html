  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>You agree that occasional unavailability of GovSite is not something that
can reasonably be avoided.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Nonetheless, dxw will make every reasonable effort to ensure that
GovSite is accessible over the internet 100% of the time, excluding periods
of planned maintenance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If despite dxw’s reasonable efforts your website is unavailable outside
of a planned maintenance period, dxw will on request refund or waive the fees
for GovSite for any period of unavailability longer than one hour.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Clause 4.3 shall not apply if the unavailability is a result of events that
are beyond dxw’s control.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>From time to time, we may need to make GovSite unavailable in order to
carry out essential maintenance. dxw will make every reasonable effort to
give you as much notice as possible when planned unavailability will occur,
and will complete such work outside the hours of 09:00-18:00 Monday-Friday
whenever it is reasonably possible.</p>

        <p>dxw may at any time make changes to GovSite without giving
notice.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Changes made by dxw under clause 5.1 will normally have no detectable
effect on existing features of GovSite. If you make a request
to us to fix a problem with the operation of your website that has arisen
out of any change we have made to GovSite, we will make reasonable efforts
to fix the reported problem.</p>
      </li>
      <li>

any feature added to GovSite may be made available to all GovSite customers.</p>

sole discretion and for an agreed fee, create that functionality.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>From time to time, dxw may deprecate GovSite features, making them
unavailable for use. If we deprecate a feature under this clause 5.5 which
materially impacts your use of GovSite, we will make every reasonable effort
(other than reinstating the feature) to accommodate your requirements. If
we cannot do so, you may terminate this contract without penalty and we will
make every reasonable effort to assist your migration to an alternative
service.</p>

      <li>
        <p>We will inform you as soon as is practical of any change which may have an
impact upon your use of GovSite.</p>

      <li>
        <p>If you create Emergency Support Tickets in situations which do
not meet the criteria for an emergency, dxw may withdraw your
ability to submit Emergency Support Tickets.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You understand that if you are experiencing an emergency but
do not create an Emergency Support Ticket, our response time
