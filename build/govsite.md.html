    <h3 id="the-service">The service</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>As part of this contract, dxw will provide a working WordPress installation
with a set of features as advertised on our website at www.govsite.com.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing, dxw will not, under this
contract, provide any service not advertised at www.govsite.com.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>GovSite must only be used in accordance with its Acceptable Usage Policy,
which forms part of this agreement.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>You agree that occasional unavailability of GovSite is not something that
can reasonably be avoided.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Nonetheless, dxw will make every reasonable effort to ensure that
GovSite is accessible over the internet 100% of the time, excluding periods
of planned maintenance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If despite dxw’s reasonable efforts your website is unavailable outside
of a planned maintenance period, dxw will on request refund or waive the fees
for GovSite for any period of unavailability longer than one hour.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Clause 4.3 shall not apply if the unavailability is a result of events that
are beyond dxw’s control.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>From time to time, we may need to make GovSite unavailable in order to
carry out essential maintenance. dxw will make every reasonable effort to
give you as much notice as possible when planned unavailability will occur,
and will complete such work outside the hours of 09:00-18:00 Monday-Friday
whenever it is reasonably possible.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="enhancement-of-the-service">Enhancement of the service</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>dxw may at any time make changes to GovSite without giving
notice.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Changes made by dxw under clause 5.1 will normally have no detectable
effect on existing features of GovSite. If you make a request
to us to fix a problem with the operation of your website that has arisen
out of any change we have made to GovSite, we will make reasonable efforts
to fix the reported problem.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>From time to time, dxw may add features to GovSite. At its sole discretion,
any feature added to GovSite may be made available to all GovSite customers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you require functionality that GovSite does not include dxw may, at its
sole discretion and for an agreed fee, create that functionality.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>From time to time, dxw may deprecate GovSite features, making them
unavailable for use. If we deprecate a feature under this clause 5.5 which
materially impacts your use of GovSite, we will make every reasonable effort
(other than reinstating the feature) to accommodate your requirements. If
we cannot do so, you may terminate this contract without penalty and we will
make every reasonable effort to assist your migration to an alternative
service.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We will inform you as soon as is practical of any change which may have an
impact upon your use of GovSite.</p>

within the period of time specified in our Service Level Agreement,
which forms part of this contract.</p>

contract must be made via Support Tickets.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You understand that any contact you make with us that is not via a
Support Ticket may be overlooked or disregarded and that any
consequent failure on our part to respond to you or take or not take
some action will not be a breach of this contract.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>At any time, you may create an Emergency Support Ticket if you
are experiencing a problem that meets the criteria for an
emergency as described in the Service Level Agreement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you create Emergency Support Tickets in situations which do
not meet the criteria for an emergency, dxw may withdraw your
ability to submit Emergency Support Tickets.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You understand that if you are experiencing an emergency but
do not create an Emergency Support Ticket, our response time
may be considerably increased and your service may be disrupted
for a prolonged period as a result.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="suspension">Suspension</h3>

protect your data or another GovSite user’s information security,
or to protect other users of the internet.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the event that the services are suspended, dxw will replace your

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>In order to resolve Support Tickets, there may be materials (“Required

informed you that they will be required.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
practical after becoming aware that they are Required Materials.</p>
