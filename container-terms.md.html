      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You understand that any contact you make with us that is not via a
Support Ticket may be overlooked or disregarded and that any
consequent failure on our part to respond to you or to take or not take

      <li>
        <p>At any time, you may create an Emergency Support Ticket if you
are experiencing a problem that meets the criteria for an
emergency as described in the Service Level Agreement.</p>
      </li>

      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="time-allowance">Time allowance</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>dxw digital’s initial fee for support is calculated from the
Time Allowance, which is based on our assessment of your website’s
likely support requirements, as stated in the proposal.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw digital will track time spent providing the services specified in this
contract in sufficient detail to be able to provide an approximation
of the time required to service your website in any given month.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In any given month, dxw digital will carry out all of the services provided
under this contract with no additional fee, provided that the Time
Allowance has not been exceeded.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In any given month, if dxw digital chooses to complete work in excess of the
Time Allowance, no additional fee will be payable. Any such work is
completed at dxw digital’s absolute discretion and the fact that dxw digital does so on
one occasion will not imply that dxw digital will do so on subsequent occasions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In any given month, if dxw digital chooses not to complete work in excess of
the Time Allowance, we may notify you, and, subject to our availability,
will complete that work if dxw digital’s fees for the additional work are paid.
dxw digital will not charge a fee for any such work without your authorisation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Time Allowance may be varied by agreement, and with a corresponding
change to dxw digital’s fees.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw digital will not ordinarily agree to a reduction in the Time Allowance if
to do so would impede our ability to provide services under this agreement
to a professional standard.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If your Time Allowance is regularly exceeded, or almost exceeded, dxw digital
may notify you that this is the case, and request that the Time
Allowance be increased.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you do not agree to increase the Time Allowance, dxw digital may require
you to reduce the workload that your website generates; for example, by
submitting fewer Support Tickets or carrying out remedial development work
at your own cost.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Time Allowance is calculated per month. Unused time is not carried
over and may not be used in any subsequent month.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>dxw digital may, for a fee, be able to advise you on alternative approaches
to managing your website that could reduce your operational costs.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Time Allowance will have no bearing on dxw digital’s provision of the
services detailed in clauses 4.1.1, 4.1.2 and 4.1.3.</p>

    </ol>
  </li>

          <li>As a last resort, it is necessary for us to do so in order to
protect your data or another user’s security, or to protect
other users of the internet.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the event that the services are suspended, dxw digital will replace your

any such failure. dxw digital can work with you to design or implement
such measures at your request for an agreed fee.</li>
      <li>Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.</li>
      <li>
        <p>In any event, dxw digital’s total liability under this agreement is
limited to the lesser of:</p>

          <li>The insured sum.</li>
        </ol>
