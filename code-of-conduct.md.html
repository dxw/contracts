<h1 id="code-of-conduct-at-a-glance">Code of Conduct: at a glance</h1>

<p>The goal of this code of conduct is to ensure that we run events where everybody feels safe, welcome and included.
We expect participants in our events to share these goals, and to take some responsibility for the experiences of others as well as themselves.</p>

<p>We ask all participants to engage positively in our events and, in whatever way they can, to help others to engage as well.</p>

<p>We insist that all participants refrain from behaviours that cause others to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome or unsafe.
If you suspect or are told that your behaviour is causing someone else to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome or unsafe, please stop what you are doing immediately. If you persist, you may be asked to leave.</p>

<h1 id="code-of-conduct-the-longer-version">Code of Conduct: the longer version</h1>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>dxw’s events should be truly open for everyone. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender (including sex), sexual orientation, neurotype, disability, ethnicity, nationality, religion, relationship/family structure or social background.  This list is not exhaustive.
This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behaviour as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour.</p>

<p>We invite all sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other participants to help us realise a safe and positive event experience for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="good-citizenship">Good citizenship</h2>

<p>A supplemental goal of this code of conduct is to develop and encourage good citizenship by encouraging participants to recognise and strengthen the relationships between what we do as technologists and the community at large.
If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our events are welcoming, friendly, and encourage all participants to contribute to their fullest extent, we want to know. We would like to recognise these efforts when we can, and use them to learn as event organisers. Please let an organiser know however you can.</p>

<h2 id="expected-behaviour">Expected behaviour</h2>

<p>Be welcoming, considerate, respectful, and collaborative. Assume that everyone at the event is there to participate and that they have something to contribute.</p>

<p>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behaviour and speech.</p>

<p>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert an organiser if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.</p>

<p>Participate in as authentic and active a way as you feel able. In doing so, you’ll help to make the event better for yourself and your fellow participants.</p>

<h2 id="unacceptable-behaviour">Unacceptable behaviour</h2>

<p>You must not engage in intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct.
For example, this includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Offensive, verbal comments related to gender (including sex), sexual orientation, neurotype, disability, ethnicity, nationality, religion, relationship/family structure or social background</li>
  <li>The use of sexualised language or imagery in a way that makes others uncomfortable (it is generally best to avoid sexualised language and imagery altogether)</li>
  <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following</li>
  <li>Unwanted photography or video recording</li>
  <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
  <li>Unconsented physical contact or sexual attention</li>
  <li>Threatening or abusive language or behaviour</li>
</ul>

<p>Where an event venue is shared with members of the public please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.</p>

<h2 id="consequences-of-unacceptable-behaviour">Consequences of unacceptable behaviour</h2>

<p>dxw will not tolerate unacceptable behaviour whether by other attendees, organisers, venue staff or sponsors.
Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in unacceptable behaviour, we may take any action we deem appropriate. This may include expulsion from the event without warning or refund.</p>

<p>Please note in advance of attending that we are unlikely to engage in debate over the minutiae of this code of conduct. It will be enforced at our discretion and the decisions of organisers are final. If you are not able to accept and abide by this condition, please do not attend.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-if-you-witness-or-are-subject-to-unacceptable-behaviour">What to do if you witness or are subject to unacceptable behaviour</h2>

<p>If you are subject to unacceptable behaviour, notice that someone else is being subject to unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify an organiser as soon as possible.</p>

<p>An event organiser will be available to help participants contact venue security or the police, to provide escorts, or to otherwise assist those experiencing unacceptable behaviour to feel safe for the duration of the event.</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>We expect all participants (sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other guests) to abide by this code of conduct at all event venues and event-related social occasions.</p>

<h2 id="contact-information">Contact information</h2>

<p>You can email us (<a href="mailto:conduct@dxw.com">conduct@dxw.com</a>) before, during, and after the event, or talk to an organiser during the event.</p>

<p>We welcome feedback on this code of conduct.</p>
